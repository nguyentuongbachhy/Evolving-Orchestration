Their habitat ranges have drastically reduced; they now occupy about 10% of their historical range, primarily found in southern and eastern Africa, with a critically endangered population in Iran.\n\n- **Interesting Facts:**\n  - Cheetahs are unique among big cats as they are primarily diurnal, hunting during the day.\n  - They prefer solitary living; males may form coalitions with brothers, whereas females are generally alone except when raising young.\n  - Cheetahs are at risk, with an estimated population of around 6,500 remaining in the wild.\n  - Unlike lions and other predators, cheetahs rely on speed rather than strength to catch prey, primarily targeting small to medium-sized ungulates, such as gazelles and impalas.\n\n**Sources:**\n1.

In Africa there are an estimated 9,000 to 12,000 cheetahs, with the largest populations existing in Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe in Southern Africa and Kenya [...] Unlike most carnivores, cheetahs are active mainly during the day, hunting in the early morning and late afternoon. A cheetah eats a variety of small animals, including game birds, rabbits, small antelopes (including the springbok, impala, and gazelle), young warthogs, and larger antelopes (such as the kudu, hartebeest, oryx, and roan).
